## Understanding the Calculations

### Hours Calculations

```
Worked Hours = (Clock-Out - Clock-In) - Unpaid Breaks
Regular Hours = MIN(Worked Hours, Expected Hours)
Overtime Hours = MAX(0, Worked Hours - Expected Hours)
Lost Time = MAX(0, Expected Hours - Worked Hours)
Utilization % = (Worked Hours √∑ Expected Hours) √ó 100
```

**Example:**
- Clock-In: 08:00, Clock-Out: 16:30
- Total Time: 8.5 hours
- Breaks: 30 min tea + 45 min lunch = 75 min (1.25 hrs)
- Paid Breaks: 30 min tea + 30 min lunch = 60 min (1.0 hr)
- Unpaid Breaks: 15 min (0.25 hr)
- **Worked Hours: 8.25 hours**
- Expected: 7.5 hours
- **Regular: 7.5 hrs, Overtime: 0.75 hrs**
- **Utilization: 110%**

### Payroll Calculations

```
Base Pay = Regular Hours √ó Hourly Rate
Overtime Pay = Overtime Hours √ó Hourly Rate √ó Overtime Multiplier
Night Allowance = Night Hours √ó Hourly Rate √ó Night Allowance %
Weekend Allowance = Weekend Hours √ó Hourly Rate √ó Weekend Allowance %

Gross Pay = Base + Overtime + Night Allowance + Weekend Allowance

Tax = Gross Pay √ó Tax Rate
Pension = Gross Pay √ó Pension Rate
Total Deductions = Tax + Health Insurance + Pension

Net Pay = Gross Pay - Total Deductions
```

**Example (Regular Day Shift):**
- Regular: 7.5 hrs, Overtime: 0.5 hrs
- Hourly Rate: $25
- Base Pay: 7.5 √ó $25 = **$187.50**
- OT Pay: 0.5 √ó $25 √ó 1.5 = **$18.75**
- **Gross: $206.25**
- Tax (15%): $30.94
- Insurance: $50.00
- Pension (5%): $10.31
- Deductions: **$91.25**
- **Net Pay: $115.00**

**Example (Night Shift with Overtime):**
- Regular: 7.5 hrs, Overtime: 1.5 hrs, All Night: 9 hrs
- Hourly Rate: $25
- Base Pay: 7.5 √ó $25 = **$187.50**
- OT Pay: 1.5 √ó $25 √ó 1.5 = **$56.25**
- Night Allowance: 9 √ó $25 √ó 0.15 = **$33.75**
- **Gross: $277.50**
- Tax (15%): $41.63
- Insurance: $50.00
- Pension (5%): $13.88
- Deductions: **$105.51**
- **Net Pay: $171.99**
