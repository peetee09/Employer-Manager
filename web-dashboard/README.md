### Hours Calculation
```
Worked Hours = Clock-Out - Clock-In - Unpaid Breaks
Regular Hours = MIN(Worked Hours, Expected Hours)
Overtime Hours = MAX(0, Worked Hours - Expected Hours)
Lost Time = MAX(0, Expected Hours - Worked Hours)
Utilization = (Worked Hours / Expected Hours) Ã— 100%
```

### Payroll Calculation
```
Base Pay = Regular Hours Ã— Hourly Rate
Overtime Pay = Overtime Hours Ã— Hourly Rate Ã— Overtime Multiplier
Night Allowance = Night Hours Ã— Hourly Rate Ã— Night Allowance %
Weekend Allowance = Weekend Hours Ã— Hourly Rate Ã— Weekend Allowance %
Gross Pay = Base Pay + Overtime Pay + Night Allowance + Weekend Allowance

Tax = Gross Pay Ã— Tax Rate
Pension = Gross Pay Ã— Pension Rate
Total Deductions = Tax + Health Insurance + Pension
Net Pay = Gross Pay - Total Deductions
```
