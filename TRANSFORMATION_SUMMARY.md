## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Formula Complexity
```
Before: Basic time calculations
├── Worked Hours = Clock-Out - Clock-In - Breaks
├── Overtime = MAX(0, Worked - Expected)
└── Utilization % = Worked / Expected × 100

After: Advanced payment calculations
├── Regular Hours = MIN(Worked, Expected)
├── Overtime Hours = MAX(0, Worked - Expected)
├── Night Hours = IF(Shift="Night", Worked, 0)
├── Base Pay = Regular Hours × Hourly Rate
├── Overtime Pay = OT Hours × Rate × Multiplier
├── Night Allowance = Night Hours × Rate × %
├── Weekend Allowance = IF(Weekend, Regular × Rate × %)
├── Gross Pay = Base + OT + Night + Weekend
├── Tax = Gross × Tax%
├── Pension = Gross × Pension%
├── Deductions = Tax + Insurance + Pension
└── Net Pay = Gross - Deductions
```

### Data Flow
